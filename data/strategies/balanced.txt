This conservative trading strategy prioritizes capital preservation and steady growth over high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Key points:

1. Focus on long-term trends rather than short-term fluctuations
2. Prioritize assets with stable histories and strong fundamentals
3. Implement wider stop-losses to avoid premature exits due to market noise
4. Prefer dividend-paying stocks or carry trades in forex
5. Diversify positions to spread risk
6. Avoid excessive leverage
7. Look for value investing opportunities in stocks
8. In forex, focus on major currency pairs with lower volatility

When applying this strategy, lean towards more cautious actions, with a preference for holding positions unless there's a strong indication to buy or sell.
